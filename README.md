# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Home Lab - My First Security Repository

Welcome to my cybersecurity home lab! This repository documents my journey and projects as I build hands-on skills in cyber defense, monitoring, and offensive testing. The goal is to showcase real-world techniques and technologies used by SOC analysts, blue teamers, and ethical hackers.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- ✅ Setting up and configuring a SIEM/EDR (Security Information and Event Management/Endpoint Detection and Response) system using **Wazuh** and **ELK**
- ✅ Monitoring endpoint logs from Windows and Linux systems
- ✅ Performing file integrity monitoring (FIM), vulnerability detection, and user activity tracking
- ✅ Running MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks safely in an offline lab using **Kali Linux** and **Ettercap**
- ✅ Practicing with firewalls, IDS/IPS (e.g., **Snort**), and basic malware detection
- ✅ Creating custom detection rules and alerts for suspicious activity

## 🧪 Projects & Experiments Projec Network Defense (Blue Team) ts & Experiments
 
### ⚙️ 1. Wazuh Lab Setup (SIEM & EDR Foundations) : [🔍 Wazuh EDR Lab](https://github.com/UVSasa/Wazuh-Siem)
- Configuration of Wazuh Agent and manager
- Setup of network components
- Setup of netork environment
- Installed and configured Sysmon for enriched Windows telemetry
- Tuned default rules to reduce noise from legitiamte system activity

###🛡️ 2. Network Defense (Blue Team)
	•	Log Monitoring: Tracked failed logins, privilege escalations (e.g., Event ID 4672), and unusual process activity
	•	Vulnerability Detection: Used Wazuh’s vulnerability-detector to identify known CVEs on Windows endpoints
	•	File Integrity Monitoring: Monitored system files and user directories for suspicious changes or DLL injections
	•	Rule Tuning: Differentiated between benign system events and potential attacks (e.g., analyzing svchost and DLL creation)

⸻

⚔️ 3. Offensive Security (Red Team)
	•	Reconnaissance & Information Gathering: Identified hosts, services, and open ports within the offline lab
	•	Vulnerability Scanning & Analysis: Scanned targets using tools like Nmap and Nikto to enumerate weaknesses
	•	Exploitation: Simulated attacks to test defensive visibility (e.g., MITM, DNS spoofing)
	•	Web Application Attacks: (Coming soon) — Will simulate OWASP Top 10-style attacks on a local vulnerable web app


### 🧬 4. Forensics
- Coming Soon
