# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Home Lab

Welcome to my cybersecurity home lab! This repository documents my journey and projects as I build hands-on skills in cyber defense, monitoring, and offensive testing. The goal is to showcase real-world techniques and technologies used by SOC analysts, blue teamers, and ethical hackers.

---

## üß† What I‚Äôm Learning

- Setting up and configuring a SIEM/EDR (Security Information and Event Management/Endpoint Detection and Response) system using **Wazuh**
- Monitoring endpoint logs from Windows and Linux systems
- Performing file integrity monitoring (FIM), vulnerability detection, and user activity tracking
- Running MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks safely in an offline lab using **Kali Linux** and **Ettercap**
- Practicing with firewalls, IDS/IPS (e.g., **Snort**), and basic malware detection
- Creating custom detection rules and alerts for suspicious activity

## üß™ Projects 
 
### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Wazuh Lab Setup (SIEM & EDR Foundations) : [üîç Wazuh EDR Lab](https://github.com/UVSasa/Wazuh-Siem)
- Configuration of Wazuh Agent and manager
- Setup of network components
- Setup of netork environment
- Installed and configured Sysmon for enriched Windows telemetry
- Tuned default rules to reduce noise from legitiamte system activity

### üõ°Ô∏è 2. Network Defense (Blue Team) :[üîç Defensive Labs](https://github.com/UVSasa/Network-Defense)
- Log Monitoring: Tracked failed logins, privilege escalations (e.g., Event ID 4672), and unusual process activity
- Vulnerability Detection: Used Wazuh‚Äôs vulnerability-detector to identify known CVEs on Windows endpoints
- File Integrity Monitoring: Monitored system files and user directories for suspicious changes or DLL injections
- Rule Tuning: Differentiated between benign system events and potential attacks (e.g., analyzing svchost and DLL creation)

### ‚öîÔ∏è 3. Offensive Security (Red Team):[üîç Offensive Labs](https://github.com/UVSasa/Offensive-Security)
- Reconnaissance & Information Gathering: Identified hosts, services, and open ports within the offline lab
- Vulnerability Scanning & Analysis: Scanned targets using tools like Nmap and Nikto to enumerate weaknesses
- Exploitation: Simulated attacks to test defensive visibility (e.g., MITM, DNS spoofing)
- Web Application Attacks: (Coming soon) ‚Äî Will simulate OWASP Top 10-style attacks on a local vulnerable web app

### üß¨ 4. Forensics
- Coming Soon
