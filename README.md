# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Home Lab - My First Security Repository

Welcome to my cybersecurity home lab! This repository documents my journey and projects as I build hands-on skills in cyber defense, monitoring, and offensive testing. The goal is to showcase real-world techniques and technologies used by SOC analysts, blue teamers, and ethical hackers.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- ✅ Setting up and configuring a SIEM/EDR (Security Information and Event Management/Endpoint Detection and Response) system using **Wazuh** and **ELK**
- ✅ Monitoring endpoint logs from Windows and Linux systems
- ✅ Performing file integrity monitoring (FIM), vulnerability detection, and user activity tracking
- ✅ Running MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks safely in an offline lab using **Kali Linux** and **Ettercap**
- ✅ Practicing with firewalls, IDS/IPS (e.g., **Snort**), and basic malware detection
- ✅ Creating custom detection rules and alerts for suspicious activity
